# broadcaster

_A python file to send messages to everyone connected to the Allen ISD network that you are currently on. Requires admin and windows 10/11._

_This will most-likely be patched soon, if it hasn't already been._

_As of now, the project isn't completed, or tested._

_The installations will work for most people, but if it doesn't for you, contact me on discord (pootato#8022) and I will create a specialized version of the code for you._

Download the project. Make sure you have a version of Python that was made after 3.4.
Run the ' pipInstallations.bat ' file.
Once the installations are done, run the ' broadcaster.py ' file and follow the instructions on that.
