# broadcaster
_A python file to send messages to everyone connected to the Allen ISD network that you are currently on. Requires admin._
_This will most-likely be patched soon, if it hasn't already been.
As of now, the project isn't completed, or tested.
The installations will work for most people, but if it doesn't for you, contact me on discord (pootato#8022) and I will create a specialized version of the code for you._

Download the project. Make sure you have a version of Python that was made after 3.4.
Run the ' pipInstallations.bat ' file.
Once the installations are done, run the ' broadcaster.py ' file and follow the instructions on that.
